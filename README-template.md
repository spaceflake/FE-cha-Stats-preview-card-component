## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![](./my-solution-desktop.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I got this little weird space under the image. Easy fix it turned out by adding a display: block; on the image.
Struggling with having border-radius when an image is involved. Have to find a better solution. 
Also need to learn more about image blending and filters.


If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.


### Continued development


Setting up a good structure and trying to do as little css as possible by using the normal flow of the web.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plOl7TNc89A) - This helped me for image space reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
